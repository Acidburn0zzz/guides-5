## Applications

With Hanami architecture, we can have multiple Hanami applications running under `apps/`.
The default application is called `Web` and lives under `apps/web`.

We can generate new applications for different components that we want to add to our project.

```shell
$ bundle exec hanami generate app admin
```

This generates an application named `Admin` under `apps/admin`.
